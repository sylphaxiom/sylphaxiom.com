# Sylphaxiom.com Website

This site will serve as my primary website for personal and professional needs.

## Details

- Frontend: React.ts
- Backend: None\*
- DB: None\*
- Host: Bluehost basic hosting plan

This website is designed as a single-page-app with a separated frontend and
backend. At the moment there is no need for a backend as it is an mostly
just an informational site. I do plan to add more functionality and contact
information to the app in the future which will require an API and DB
connections. That work can be seen in the DnD-App project that is currently
ongoing as well.

\* At present I have no need for a backend, but I do intend to use PHP scripts
for the API and MySQL as the DB.
